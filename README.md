# ARDUINO-BASED AUTONOMOUS RC AIRCRAFT

This project aims to build an Arduino-based autopilot for an RC aircraft from scratch, using only normal arduino libraries and writting everything else for myself.


## How to build

Place all folders except for the one containing the main code inside the arduino libraries path and compile with the Arduino IDE.
